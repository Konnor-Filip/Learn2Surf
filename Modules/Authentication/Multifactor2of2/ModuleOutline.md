Starting on 10/6
## Module Title: Multifactor Authentication (2/2)
### Module Time: See individual micro-modules
### Assumptions: Students have used passwords before.
### Materials: See individual micro-modules
### Definitions:
* Two-Factor Authentication
* Factors of Authentication
  * Something you are (Biomentrics)
  * Something you have (Token: Smart card/one-time passcode)
  * Something you know (Password/PIN)
  * Somewhere you are (Geo-location)
  * Something you do (Mouse movement/signiture)
### Learning Objectives:
* Students will be able to differentiate between the five different factors of authentication. 
* Students are able to describe the types of authentication methods that are most commonly used.
* Students are able to implement the correct level of protection for various types of accounts and devices.
* Students are able to differentiate the positives and negatives of using single-factor authentication vs a multi-factor authentication method.

#### Class Discovery (Teacher):
???

### Warm-up:
(WIP) Include Think Pair Share questions

## Group Activities (Micro-modules):
### Whole Class Activities:
**Introduction to multi-factor authentication (Size: Any, Time: 10-20 minutes, Required resources: Provided slides and either access to a computer or a whiteboard)** <br>
**Show**: (Slide-Something you know, something you have, something you are) <br>
**Say**: Passwords are just one type of authentication that help to make sure it is really you on an account. There are many different ways that help keep others out of your accounts.

**Show**: (Side-Something you know) <br>
**Say**: The most common type of authentication is something-you-know. Passwords are the most frequently used something-you-know authentication. <br>
**Ask**: Have you or someone that you know ever used an ATM? What was needed to use it? (Expected responses: a card and a PIN number, hint as needed. An alternative to an ATM include a checkout at a store) <br>
**Say**: A PIN number is another something-you-know. The card is an example of something-you-have.

**Show**: (Slide-Something you have) <br>
**Say**: Bank cards or credit cards are examples of something-you-have.  <br>
**Ask**: When unlocking a phone have any of you used something besides a PIN number? (Expected responses: fingerprint or face)

**Show**: (Slide-Something you are) <br>
**Say**: Fingerprints, eye scanners, facial recognition, and voice recognition are each examples of a biometric authentication and fall under something-you-are.

Have the students break down into individuals or small groups to come up with other examples of authentication they have seen before. Let them work for 3-5 minutes. 

Once time is up, have them volunteer examples they have come up with. Record the responses for all to see (whiteboard or computer).

**Discuss**: Go through the responses and identify which ones are single authentication, two-factor authentication, and some ways that additional authentication can be added. <br>
**Example**-Bank card: PIN-know/Card-have <br>
**Example**-Online account: Password-know/Phone-have

### Small Group:
Group Size: 3-4 <br>
Time: 15-20 Minutes <br>
Materials: Paper, a Bucket or Basket, pens or pencils, and paperclips. <br>

This activity will consist of two parts. <br>
**Part 1**: <br>
Students will be given a bucket or basket that will be the “Warehouse” for this activity. Students will be given a list of Truck Numbers that they will need to check to ensure that only trucks that are allowed into the Warehouse are granted access. Students will discuss together as a group whether or not the truck should be allowed to be placed into the bucket. This portion of the activity is designed to be relatively easy, students will only need to check to see if the Truck’s Number is on the list. This is designed to be a “Something you know” type of authentication. 

The teacher will gather the student's attention for a quick intermission. Pausing briefly to get the student's thoughts. The teacher will pose a new question. “What if a driver who isn’t allowed inside of the warehouse drives a truck that is allowed? How do we solve this problem?” This leads to the second part.

**Part 2**: <br>
Students will empty the bucket and new trucks, with Driver ID’s attached will be given to the students along with a new list that pairs a Truck number with a driver ID. Only the combination of the two will be allowed to enter. The Driver ID serves as a “Something you have” type of authentication. Students will then place Trucks with the IDs that they believe should be allowed to enter. Interesting combinations should be used such as
	* A driver who isn’t allowed into the warehouse but a truck is
	* A driver who is allowed into the warehouse but a truck that isn’t allowed.
	* A driver and a truck who are both allowed to enter but do not match on the sheet. 


## Individual (Nano-Modules):
(WIP: Why biometrics are difficult. Matching game using very similar cards. Lesson in false-positives/false-negatives)

### Wrap-up:
(WIP: Quiz, requires feasability analysis from tech crew)

# Course: Authentication
## Module Title: Password Creation/Safety (1/2)
### Module Time:
### Assumptions: Assume that the student knows what a password is for (logging into an account).
### Materials: Projector for slides, access to a computer
### Definitions:
* Password
* Brute Force Attack
* Dictionary Attack
* Password Reuse Attack
### Learning Objectives:
* Students will be able to understand the rationale behind the most common password attacks and how they can compromise a password. 
* Students will be able to differentiate between good and bad passwords with regard to the most common password attacks. 
* Students will be able to construct passwords that are both memorable and secure against the most common password attacks.
* Students will be able to create memorization techniques that will allow the students to more easily remember secure passwords. 
* Students will be able to recognize a social engineering attempt to gain password information.
* Students recognize the different aspects of password safety.
    * Students will be able to explain why recording passwords reduces their effectiveness 
    * Students will be able to explain why password reuse can create problems. 
    * Students will be able to explain why password sharing can be dangerous.
### Basic Concepts:
Below are a few concepts to help establish your own lessons. Also helpful in creating a short 5-10 minute lesson.<br>
1. Identify ways that others learn our passwords.
* Brute force: Hackers can create programs that check every possible combination millions of times per second.
* Dictionary attack: Brute force attack that adds in words that might be associated with that particular account.
* Mask attack: Brute force attack that knows part of the password.
* Password reuse attack: Passwords that have been used on other accounts are tested.
2. Explain techniques to create secure passwords, maintain their secrecy, and be able to be remembered.
* Password complexity: Length and variety of characters to include (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters/symbols)
* Donâ€™t share passwords: Any time a password is shared, a third party is able to pick it up (unsecure connections). Additionally, you never know if the individual may attempt to use the account linked to the password for an unintended purpose.
* Recording passwords: Never write down your passwords directly.
   * Memorizing your password is theoretically the best, but remembering a secure jumble of characters is impractical. Recorded but encrypted is a reasonable option.
* Password managers: These may be useful if many accounts must be maintained, but explain that caution must be taken due to a single point of failure.



### Class Discovery (Teacher):
What type of groups does your class work well in?
What size of groups can you divide your class into?
What ways do your students learn best? 

### Password Safety Module Overview:
   * How are passwords cracked?
   * How do we create a strong password?
   * How can we remember our passwords?
### Warm-up:
[comment]: <> (&#40;Should be challenging but not too challenging so that kids get interested&#41;)
Teacher shows multiple passwords on screen. Students use Think Pair Share to determine which passwords are good and which are bad.
   
### Whole Class Discussion (PowerPoint Slides):
Teacher will ask the students to share where they use passwords in their lives. Ex. social media, email, school accounts etc. Teacher has a discussion with the class on why they believe it is important to have a password for their information. Then leads into how to build a strong password. (Slides needed) After slides they will move into three activities.

### Group Activities (Best 2/3 way through lesson, choose one or both):
**Make sure that students do NOT use their own passwords during activities**<br>
#### Activity One: Build-a-pass(word)
* Students get into groups and have each group create a password that they believe is secure.
* The groups will then discuss why they think that password is safe.
* Check password against a password checking program. Free online programs include https://howsecureismypassword.net/ and https://www.passwordmonster.com/.

#### Activity Two: Gatekeeper
* Students pair up and one is assigned the password protector and one is assigned the password getter.
* The protector is given a password and they must prevent the getter from retrieving the password.
* The getter can use any methods they can think of to try to social engineer the protector to giving up the password.

### Individual Wrap-up (Worksheet):
Have students share what they learned through this exercise. Also, have them think about how the passwords will affect their lives and how they can implement what they learned in class.

### Teacher Reflection: 
Up to the teacher to determine if they enjoyed the lesson and would like to teach it further.

# Progress Report (12/14/2021)
## Overview
(insert brief overview of efforts made)
Working on Learn2Surf was a challenging and rewarding endeavor as we had to overcome many obstacles. Like many challenges, we had to come together as a group and devise a plan to accomplish our intended goal of creating a resource for teachers to able teach K to 12 students cybersecurity. This was all in the hopes of inspiring more students to go into cybersecurity. All the work and effort we did lead to several outcomes in the making of the project. Some of the outcomes are:

## Hinderances
(insert brief discussion of challenges encountered) (feel free to add to this)

While working on Learn2Surf, we experienced many hindrances that we had to overcome as a team. Our website was a major concern as it took lots of trial and error to get it to a working condition. Once it started to work, we had to go back and change some of the framework that we were using since it didnâ€™t allow us the freedom that we wanted. From that point on it was a matter of getting the website to look presentable and ready for everyone to use. We also ran into some issues with content, the major being the large prevelance of content on cyberbullying and social media safety. We made the decision to not create completely new and instead used those sections as an aggregated resource for teachers.

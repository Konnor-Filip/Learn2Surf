## Forward
There is extensive information and research on the subject of cyberbully prevention and remediation. 
The purpose of this module is not to give a single, all-encompassing lesson but instead give directions to existing lessons.
These lessons focus on a different aspect of difficulties that children face online.
It is recommended to either: 
- Teach one or more linked modules as is.
- Incorporate parts from the modules into your teaching style.

## Basic Concepts
Below are a few major concepts to help establish your own lessons covering cyberbullying.
### 1. Identifying what (cyber)bullying looks like.
* What identifies as bullying:
  * ”Seek to harm, intimidate, or coerce (someone perceived as vulnerable)”
  * Repeated attempts to upset or harass someone.
  * Incidents in which one party is at an advantage and uses that power over the other.
    * This can be physical strength, information, materials, and/or influence.
* What does not identify as bullying:
  * Single incident of rejection, aggression, or negative social interaction.
  * Mutual disagreements between two parties, neither utilizes an advantage in the situation.
### 2. Learn how to discourage and/or stop others from bullying “you”.
* First steps:
  * Take an emotional step back and work out if this is just banter or malicious in nature.
  * In either case let the other party know that you aren’t comfortable with the situation.
* Secondary steps:
  * If the other party de-escalates, save evidence (if possible) of the interaction and calmly go through it with someone you trust. Don’t take action unless it is determined that danger is presented to either party.
  * If the other party continues, attempt to disengage from the situation. Save all possible evidence and details from the event. Talk to someone you trust, an adult if possible. Determine what to do from there with advice. Whatever the action is, don’t consider revenge as a motivator.
* Future considerations:
  * Block contact if necessary. Do not respond to bullying.
  * Never seek revenge. This ends up causing large problems in the future.
### 3. Learn how to de-escalate if you’ve identified that you have been bullying others.
* First steps: (focus on cyber)
  * Remove what content you can that offended the other party.
  * Apologize to the other party about the actions you have taken.
  * Talk with any others that have become involved in the situation.
* Future considerations:
  * Monitor if others are still bullying due to the content. Discourage this where possible.

Consider adding the following common activity concepts to the lesson:
### 1. Situation cards / emotions perceived by them
* For variation: Describe the relationship between the two parties, the platform on which it was shared.
* Additional action: What would be the next action to take if the student is put into the position of either party (or perhaps both).
* Example: “You upload a picture of you and a friend out at a restaurant. A third party posts a negative comment on the picture”
### 2. Analysing prop social media posts
* Additional action: Show more context for the post. This can be good to demonstrate what is actually happening rather than the initial emotional reaction.

                        <p>Phishing is one of the most common types of cyber attacks going on in the world right now. These attacks
                            focus on a type of attack known as social-engineering. Social-engineering is when someone attempts to
                            decieve you in order to get you to do something. In terms of cyber attacks, attackers decieve you into
                            giving up your credentials. Or credit card information.Obviously no one wants that to happen to them.
                            However, by creating content around phishing awareness and what an individual can do to stop it,
                            phishing attacks become less effective.

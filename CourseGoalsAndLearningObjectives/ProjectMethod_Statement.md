We understand that our project, Learn2Surf, is neither the first or last in a long line of instructional modules. To ensure we create a product that has meaning amongst the we will focus on a few specific guidelines:
1. **Focused age group.** We want the target audience to be American middle school aged children, specifically 10 to 14 years of age. We predict this age group would be the earliest to not only retain the information presented, but also apply and understand the “why” of the lessons learned.
2. **Learn from the past.** Others have created lessons on this subject; our goal is to take the successes and failures of the past instructions and apply them to our lessons. Additionally, the reason for the creation of our lessons is due to the rapid changes that occur in technology compared to many other subjects. Lessons must be re-evaluated more frequently to keep pace with cultural changes.
3. **Modularity.** We know that not all instructors will want or have time to use every part of the content we create.
4. **Interest.** Credit to Angela Garber, the phrase “Death by PowerPoint” continues to be relevant years later. Instead of lectures that would quickly be tuned out we would focus on creating activities for each module. Our ideal lessons would give students something to work with, experiment with, make mistakes, and ultimately learn from. The instructor’s role would be to set the stage and guide as needed rather than required to explain everything.

To help us better measure effectiveness of the modules, we plan to follow the framework as outlined by 
[Montclair State University](https://www.montclair.edu/information-technology/teaching-essentials/learning-objectives)

Our plan for the project is to begin with research into different teaching methods, the goal of this is to find a method that students in the 6 to 8 grade level will find engaging and allow them to absorb the material. 

We plan to search through different teaching styles and learning experiences that will best fit the needs of the project. From this research our intent is to create a basic framework for our course that will be adaptable to each of the different course modules. Our intent is to develop Github pages to host our modules so they are easily accessible and can be changed to fit the teachers needs. 

We will begin our first large sprint with the intention of splitting into two teams for the duration of the 5 week sprint. The goal with the start of each sprint will be to research each topic to ensure that all important details for each course are included, flushed out and taught in an easy to digestible way. After the research of the course topic has been completed we will move on to using the framework that was developed in week one to begin creating our curriculum for the course. Once the curriculum is finished we will develop a detailed plan with lesson plans that teachers will be able to follow along to teach students. For each step in this process of creating the total topic we will contact our project stakeholders and Dr Hale to gain feedback to ensure the content is valuable. After the content is approved the Github pages site will be updated with each course's relevant material. 

The final two weeks of our project we plan to run back through the modules and correct any mistakes, then coordinate with Dr. Hale and our Stakeholders to ensure that the content is sound and ready to be released. 

We have already roughly identified the description of the course from there we have five course goals to focus on in order of priority.
1. Authentication
2. Social media safety
3. Phishing
4. Malware

From here we have further identified some possible learning objectives and associated activities that will follow each of the four guidelines. Each of them will be refined further during the research and template development point in our project timeline.

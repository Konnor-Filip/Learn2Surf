# Learn2Surf
## Executive Summary
Cybersecurity is crucial to the field of information technology. It applies to every aspect of computing especially when it comes to the internet. Due to how susceptible kids are to threats on the internet, making students aware of these threats and how they can protect themselves online is the goal of this project. Learn2Surf aims to teach kids about phishing, social media safety, malware, two factor authentication, and password safety. Internet safety and etiquette, are an important part of cybersecurity. By teaching children how to be safe online, we can decrease the number of malicious events that transpire and make the internet a safer place to surf.

## Project Goals
The goals of this project are simple in design but something we feel important. This project has three main goals:
1. Teach kids about how to stay safe online. 
2. To teach students about the topics listed below.
3. To spark excitement and interest in the field of cyber security. 
* We wish to Inform Students about the following topics
    * [Authentication](#authentication)
      * Password Safety
      * Mutlifactor Authentication
    * [Prevention](#Prevention)
      * Phishing
      * Malware 
    * [Online Safety](#online-safety)
      * Cyberbullying
      * Online Privacy 

## Project Methodology
We understand that our project, Learn2Surf, is neither the first or last in a long line of instructional modules. To ensure we create a product that has meaning amongst the we will focus on a few specific guidelines:
1. **Focused age group.** We want the target audience to be American middle school aged children, specifically 10 to 14 years of age. We predict this age group would be the earliest to not only retain the information presented, but also apply and understand the “why” of the lessons learned.
2. **Learn from the past.** Others have created lessons on this subject; our goal is to take the successes and failures of the past instructions and apply them to our lessons. Additionally, the reason for the creation of our lessons is due to the rapid changes that occur in technology compared to many other subjects. Lessons must be re-evaluated more frequently to keep pace with cultural changes.
3. **Modularity.** We know that not all instructors will want or have time to use every part of the content we create.
4. **Interest.** Credit to Angela Garber, the phrase “Death by PowerPoint” continues to be relevant years later. Instead of lectures that would quickly be tuned out we would focus on creating activities for each module. Our ideal lessons would give students something to work with, experiment with, make mistakes, and ultimately learn from. The instructor’s role would be to set the stage and guide as needed rather than required to explain everything.

To help us better measure effectiveness of the modules, we plan to follow the framework as outlined by
[Montclair State University](https://www.montclair.edu/information-technology/teaching-essentials/learning-objectives)

After research we landed upon the middle school level to build our modules, being the 6th to 8th grade range. We tailored each of the modules to be understanble and digestable to students in that age range. 

We searched through different teaching styles and learning experiences to find those that best fit the needs of our project. From this research our we created a basic framework for our courses that we used to adapt to each of the different course modules. We developed a website that is host using GitHub pages so we can present the content in it's best light to teachers. We started designing each lesson through a PowerPoint first mentality designing each lesson to flow well and to be interesting for students to interact with and not overwhelmed by the amount of information on screen. From here we developed teachers guides that allows teachers who maybe be inexperienced with one of the given topics. Worksheets and acivity guides are also available through the website, our GitHub pages and a Google Drive. 

We will began our first large sprint with the intention of splitting into two teams for the duration of the 5 week sprint. The goal with the start of each sprint was to research each topic to ensure that all important details for each course are included, flushed out and taught in an easy to digestible way. After the research of the course topic has been completed we moved on to using the framework that was developed in week one to began creating our curriculum for the course. Once the curriculum was finished we  developed a detailed plan with lesson plans that teachers will be able to follow along to teach students. For each step in this process of creating the total topic we stayed in contact with Dr Hale to gain feedback to ensure the content is valuable. After the content was approved the Github pages site was updated with each course's relevant material.

The final two weeks of our project were used to correct any mistakes and then coordinate with Dr. Hale and our Stakeholders to ensure that the content was sound and ready to be released.

During our research we discovered 3 topics that we planned to expand on with individual modules, these topics include: 
1. [Authentication](#authentication)
      * Password Safety
      * Mutlifactor Authentication
2. [Prevention](#Prevention)
      * Phishing
      * Malware 
2. [Online Safety](#online-safety)
      * Cyberbullying
      * Online Privacy 

From here our team have further identified learning objectives and associated activities that will follow each of the four guidelines. 

## Authentication
### Password Safety Learning Objectives: 
Completeing this course students should be expected to:
* ***Understand*** the rationale behind the most common password attacks and how they can compromise a password. 
* ***Differentiate*** between good and bad passwords with regard to the most common password attacks. 
* ***Construct*** passwords that are both memorable and secure against the most common password attacks.
* ***Create*** memorization techniques that will allow the students to more easily remember secure passwords. 
* ***Recognize*** a social engineering attempt to gain password information.

## Results / Findings
### Milestone 1:
We started off by outlining our overall focus and the courses we wanted to develop. <br>
* Focus on modular lessons, Middle school age group, and attempting to avoid pure lecture in favor of class interaction.
* We started with five course goals: Password safety, Social media safety, Phishing, Malware, Multi-factor authentication.
* The groups were split into a content creation team and a web development team.
   * Content creation: Adam, CJ, and Daniel.
   * Web development: Konnor and Octavio.
### Milestone 2:
We continued to progress on our content and website development. <br>
#### Content:
* We refined our course goals after further research into the various topics.
* The goals now consisted of three main subjects with two underlying lessons in each.
   * Authentication: Passwords and Multifactor Authentication (Complete).
   * Social Media Safety: Cyberbullying and Web Privacy.
   * Prevention: Malware and Phishing.
* We further refined what each lesson should contain (Teacher script, powerpoint, activities).
#### Website:
* Layout of the website was created with github.
* Basic links to the associated content pages were implemented.
### Milestone 3:
We were able to get direct feedback from an active middle school teacher for our content and website.  <br>
This helped to focus our final designs of the content and the website. <br>
#### Content:
* Cyberbullying and Web Privacy lessons deviated by providing links to many different lessons created by professional organizations. Each was given short descriptions and estimated durations for ease of selection.
* Malware and Phishing were created in our traditional approach. (Teacher script, powerpoint, activities).
* All six lessons were provided with a short “Basic Principles” to give teachers a 5-10 minute lesson to go over with students. These principles also are able to serve as a foundation for creating their own lesson plans. <br>
#### Website:
* Layout was streamlined. 
   * Each lesson had a quick introduction to allow the teacher to understand the module quickly.
   * The pages display the lesson for quick use.
* A google account was created and filled with all necessary resources.
   * Each lesson page also has a quick link to its associated resources for convenience.

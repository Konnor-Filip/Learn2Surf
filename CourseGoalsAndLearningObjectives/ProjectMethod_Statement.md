We understand that our project, Learn2Surf, is neither the first or last in a long line of instructional modules. To ensure we create a product that has meaning amongst the we will focus on a few specific guidelines:
1. **Focused age group.** We want the target audience to be American middle school aged children, specifically 10 to 14 years of age. We predict this age group would be the earliest to not only retain the information presented, but also apply and understand the “why” of the lessons learned.
2. **Learn from the past.** Others have created lessons on this subject; our goal is to take the successes and failures of the past instructions and apply them to our lessons. Additionally, the reason for the creation of our lessons is due to the rapid changes that occur in technology compared to many other subjects. Lessons must be re-evaluated more frequently to keep pace with cultural changes.
3. **Modularity.** We know that not all instructors will want or have time to use every part of the content we create.
4. **Interest.** Credit to Angela Garber, the phrase “Death by PowerPoint” continues to be relevant years later. Instead of lectures that would quickly be tuned out we would focus on creating activities for each module. Our ideal lessons would give students something to work with, experiment with, make mistakes, and ultimately learn from. The instructor’s role would be to set the stage and guide as needed rather than required to explain everything.

To help us better measure effectiveness of the modules, we plan to follow the framework as outlined by

We have already roughly identified the description of the course from there we have five course goals to focus on in order of priority.
1. Password safety
2. Social media safety
3. Phishing
4. Malware
5. Multi-factor authentication

From here we have further identified some possible learning objectives and associated activities that will follow each of the four guidelines. Each of them will be refined further during the research and template development point in our project timeline.

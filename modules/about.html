                    <p>The internet can be a scary place and we need a lifeguard. During our research we found areas
                        that lacked educational content that is centered around helping children stay safe online.
                        Learn2Surf is a capstone project started by a group of 5 students with the intent of creating
                        internet safety and cyber security themed lesson plans for teachers. These lesson plans are
                        created with a focus on helping students in 6th to 8th grade navigate the internet safely. We
                        have split each lesson into 3 different categories: Authentication, Online Safety and Prevention
                        with each including two micro modules. We look forward to helping educate your students, so
                        letâ€™s grab a board and hit the web!

                <p>People from all over the world struggle with making secure accounts. Whether those accounts be social
                    media, finacial institutions, email, etc. For example, the following list is the top 10 most common
                    passwords of 2021.</p>
                <ol style="display: table;margin: 0 auto;">
                    <li>123456</li>
                    <li>123456789</li>
                    <li>qwerty</li>
                    <li>password</li>
                    <li>12345</li>
                    <li>qwerty123</li>
                    <li>1q2w3e</li>
                    <li>12345678</li>
                    <li>111111</li>
                    <li>1234567890</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Something as simple as creating a strong password is still something we strive for today. Something
                    that can aid in strong passwords is multifactor authentication. With the use of multifactor
                    authentication, even when someone does know your password. You still have control over who can
                    access your account. Have you ever been asked to verify a code on your phone or email after logging
                    into your account? That is multifactor authentication, and it is a powerful tool to ensure only you
                    have access.By creating educational content that can teach kids why authentication is important we
                    hope to increase the cybersecurity of the internet and protect everyone's accounts.</p>

                    <p>Phishing is one of the most common types of cyber attacks going on in the world right now. These
                        attacks focus on a type of attack known as social-engineering. Social-engineering is when
                        someone attempts to decieve you in order to get you to do something. In terms of cyber attacks,
                        attackers decieve you into giving up your credentials. Or credit card information.Obviously no
                        one wants that to happen to them. However, by creating content around phishing awareness and
                        what an individual can do to stop it, phishing attacks become less effective.

                    <p>While phishing is on the rise in terms of number of attacks. The most common type of cyber attack
                        is malware. Malware is a piece of malicious software that could damage your computer, steal
                        finacial information or be used to spy on individuals. In recent news WannaCry, a type of
                        malware known as ransomware, spread throughout Europe an caused an estimated $4 billion in
                        losses. With the threat of losing data, money, or even your computer, malware is something to be
                        taken seriously. So We are creating content to help teach children about what malware is, how to
                        avoid it, and how they can protect themselves from it.</p>

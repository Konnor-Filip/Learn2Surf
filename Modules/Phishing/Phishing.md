### Basic Concepts
Below are a few concepts to help establish your own lessons. Also helpful to create a short 5-10 minute lesson.
1. Identifying a phishing attempt
* Poor spelling/grammar
  * Most phishing attacks are designed to target as many victims as possible. If a program is generating the message, they typically have good spelling but terrible grammar...especially if it is being translated from a foreign language.
  * Additionally, terrible spelling/grammar can be purposeful. Those who don’t take the time to check the message carefully are also much more likely to fall for the attack.
* Urgency
  * Phishing attacks try to pressure the victim into making hasty decisions. Careful thinking is the best defense and attackers know this.
* Unsolicited (not asked for)
  * Messages that you don’t expect should be considered suspicious.
* Requests for information or actions
  * Messages that require you to send information (personal or seemingly benign) or navigate via a link should be considered suspicious.
2. What to do to mitigate the effects of phishing
* Research it
  * If you get a suspicious message, do a cursory search on the internet. Scams get pointed out frequently.
  * Locate the contact information from a known legitimate source. Don’t trust anything in the message.
* Report it
  * Forward the message, with adult assistance, to authorities that deal with phishing.
  * Let your friends know so they don’t fall victim to it.
* Ignore it
  * Once you let others know that the attack exists, don’t interact with the message. Attempting to “outsmart” the attacker is likely to cause problems.

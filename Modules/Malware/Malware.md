### Basic Concepts
Below are a few concepts to help establish your own lessons. Also helpful to create a short 5-10 minute lesson.
1. Types of malware and the danger they can present
* Direct interference: These are the most identifiable of malware. They slow and/or stop the victim device from working as intended.
  * Examples: Ransomware, Hijacker, Direct action
* Information gathering: These are the middle of the road when it comes to detectability. These types of malware are actively performing a task that slow down the device yet present little else to the user. They exist to gather information and send it off to a specific “home” destination.
  * Examples: Spyware, Adware, Keyloggers
* Backdoor: These are typically very small and very subtle programs. They exist to enable other types of malware to infiltrate the device.
  * Examples: Rootkits, Worms
2. Malware prevention
* Awareness. For every device, there is malware for it. For every anti-virus, there is malware that can evade it. Be cautious at all times.
* Keep device software updated. Malware tends to target insecurities in how a device or a program on it works. Updates exist to not only bring new features but also to remove insecurities when possible.
* Avoid links, websites, and software that are untrustworthy. Beware anything that presents urgency, asks too little for what it offers, or comes from an unusual source.

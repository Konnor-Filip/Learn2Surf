                <p>While phishing is on the rise in terms of number of attacks. The most common type of cyber attack is
                    malware. Malware is a piece of malicious software that could damage your computer, steal finacial
                    information or be used to spy on individuals. In recent news WannaCry, a type of malware known as
                    ransomware, spread throughout Europe an caused an estimated $4 billion in losses. With the threat of
                    losing data, money, or even your computer, malware is something to be taken seriously. So We are
                    creating content to help teach children about what malware is, how to avoid it, and how they can
                    protect
                    themselves from it.</p>

                    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
                    <p>During this course, students will be able to</p>
                    <ul style="display:table;">
                        <li><b>Differentiate</b> between the five different factors of authentication.</li>
                        <li><b>Describe</b> the types of authentication methods that are most commonly used.</li>
                        <li><b>Implement</b> the correct level of protection for various types of accounts and devices.</li>
                        <li><b>Differentiate</b> the positives and negatives of using single-factor authentication vs a multi-factor authentication method.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Class Discovery (Teacher)</h2>
                    <p>What type of groups does your class work well in?
                        What size of groups can you divide your class into?
                        What ways do your students learn best?</p>
                    <h2>Warm-up</h2>
                    <p>Students will be asked about where they use authentication in their lives. This can include logging in with passwords,
                    using a student ID card at the library, a locker combination, etc. The teacher will have the students discuss how the
                    forms of authentication are different from each other as a lead up to introducing the 5 different forms of
                    authentication.</p>
                    <h2>Whole Class Discussion</h2>
                    <p><b>Introduction to multi-factor authentication (Size: Any, Time: 10-20 minutes, Required resources: Provided slides and
                    either access to a computer or a whiteboard)</b></p>
                    <p>Using the provided teacher guide and powerpoint in the Google Drive, use the Show-Ask-Say format to get the class discussion. Here is an example taken from the lesson:</p>
                    <h3>Example</h3>
                    <p><b>Show:</b>(Slide-Authentication definition slide)</p>
                    <p><b>Ask:</b> What does Authentication mean?</p>
                    <p><b>Say:</b> Authentication is the process or action of verifying the identity of a user or process.</p>
                    <p>Following this, Have the students break down into individuals or small groups to come up with other examples of authentication they have
                    seen before. Let them work for 3-5 minutes.
                    Once time is up, have them volunteer examples they have come up with. Record the responses for all to see (whiteboard or
                    computer).
                    Discuss: Go through the responses and identify which ones are single authentication, two-factor authentication, and some
                    ways that additional authentication can be added.</p>

                    <p><b>Example 1:</b> Online Account: Password-Know/Phone-Have</p>
                    <p><b>Example 2:</b> Credit Card: PIN-Know/Card-Have</p>

                <p>While phishing is on the rise in terms of number of attacks. The most common type of cyber attack is
                    malware. Malware is a piece of malicious software that could damage your computer, steal finacial
                    information or be used to spy on individuals. In recent news WannaCry, a type of malware known as
                    ransomware, spread throughout Europe an caused an estimated $4 billion in losses. With the threat of
                    losing data, money, or even your computer, malware is something to be taken seriously. So We are
                    creating content to help teach children about what malware is, how to avoid it, and how they can protect
                    themselves from it.</p>

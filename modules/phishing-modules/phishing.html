          <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
          <p>By completing this course students can be expected to be able to:</p>
          <ul style="display:table;">
            <li><b>Identify</b> features of a phishing attempt in an email/text-message.</li>
            <li><b>Differentiate</b>between legitimate communications and phishing attempts.</li>
            <li><b>Understand</b> execute the steps necessary to report and delete phishing attempts.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
          <p>Below are a few concepts to help establish your own lessons. Also helpful to create a short 5-10 minute
            lesson.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Identifying a phishing attempt<ul>
            </li>
            <li>Poor spelling/grammar<ul>
                <li>Most phishing attacks are designed to target as many victims as possible. If a program is generating the message, they
                typically have good spelling but terrible grammar...especially if it is being translated from a foreign language.</li>
                <li>Additionally, terrible spelling/grammar can be purposeful. Those who don't take the time to check the message carefully
                are also much more likely to fall for the attack.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Urgency<ul>
                <li>Phishing attacks try to pressure the victim into making hasty decisions. Careful thinking is the best defense and
                attackers know this.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Unsolicited (not asked for)<ul>
                <li>Messages that you don't expect should be considered suspicious.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Requests for information or actions<ul>
                <li>Messages that require you to send information (personal or seemingly benign) or navigate via a link should be considered
                suspicious.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <li>What to do to mitigate the effects of phishing<ul>
            </li>
            <li>See if anyone else has recieved a similar message.<ul>
            <li>If you get a suspicious message, do a cursory search on the internet. Scams get pointed out frequently.</li>
            <li>Locate the contact information from a known legitimate source. Don't trust anything in the message.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
            <li>Report it<ul>
                <li>Forward the message, with adult assistance, to authorities that deal with phishing.</li>
                <li>Let your friends know so they don't fall victim to it.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
              <li>Ignore it<ul>
                  <li>Once you let others know that the attack exists, don't interact with the message. Attempting to “outsmart” the attacker
                  is likely to cause problems.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ol>

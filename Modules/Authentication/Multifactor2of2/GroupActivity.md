## Group Activity

#### Materials
* Envelopes
* Print outs of cards
* Paper clips to keep envelopes/cards organized

#### Preparation
* Groups of 5 students
* Groups of  5 envelopes with cards inside

#### Goal
Students will roleplay using the "Something they know" and "Something they are" topics that were taught in the lesson. 

#### Activity
Have the students get into groups of five. Give 5 envelopes to each group. Inside the envelopes will be one of three roles for the student to be. Each set of envelopes should have 1 authenticator, 1 gatekeeper, and 3 personnel.

1. Authenticator (1) - This student will have a card in their envelope with the correct authentication to go through the gate. 
2. Gatekeeper (1) - This student will have a card in their envelope that shows which two types of authentication the personnel need to show to get through the gate. 
3. Personnel (3) - These students will have five different card in their envelope. These cards will consist of an eye, a fingerprint, a handprint, a password, and a pin number. Each student will have a different variation of these cards (colors/symbols). 

To start the role play the gatekeeper will say "I need to see ______ and ______ forms of authentication to get through the gate." The blanks are the two types of authentication that were provided in the envelope.

Next a personnel will approach the gate and show the two types of authentication requested by the gatekeeper. 

Then the Authenticator will check the color/symbols of the authentication that the personnel showed. If they are correct the authenticator will say "Authentication Matched". If one does not match they will say "_____ Matches but ______ does not". Else if neither matches they will say "Authentication Denied"

Based on the Authenticators answer the gatekeeper will either let the personnel through the gate or tell them sorry they are not allowed through.

This process then repeats with the next personnel. 

After the groups have finished have the students put their cards back in the envelopes  and pass them to the next group. This will give each student a chance to play one of the three roles in the game. Repeat for as long as time allows.

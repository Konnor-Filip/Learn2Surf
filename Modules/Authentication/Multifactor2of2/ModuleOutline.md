### Definitions:
* Multi-Factor
* Factors of Authentication
  * Something you are
  * Something you have
  * Something you know
  * Somewhere you are
  * Something you do 
### Learning Objectives:

#### Class Discovery (Teacher):

### Warm-up:
Include Think Pair Share questions
### Activities (Nano-modules):
### Whole Class:

### Group:
Group Size: 3-4 <br>
Time: 15-20 Minutes <br>
Materials: Paper, a Bucket or Basket, pens or pencils, and paperclips. <br>

This Active will consist of two distinct parts.
Part 1:
Students will be given a bucket or basket that will be the “Warehouse” for this activity. Students will be given a list of Truck Numbers that they will need to check to ensure that only trucks that are allowed into the Warehouse are granted access. Students will discuss together as a group whether or not the truck should be allowed to be placed into the bucket. This portion of the activity is designed to be relatively easy, students will only need to check to see if the Truck’s Number is on the list. This is designed to be a “Something you know” type of authentication. 

The teacher will gather students' attention for a quick intermission. Pausing briefly to get the student's thoughts. The teacher will pose a new question. “What if a driver who isn’t allowed inside of the warehouse drives a truck that is allowed? How do we solve this problem?” This leads to the second part.

Part 2:
Students will empty the bucket and new trucks, with Driver ID’s attached will be given to the students along with a new list that pairs a Truck number with a driver ID. Only the combination of the two will be allowed to enter. The Driver ID serves as a “Something you have” type of authentication. Students will then place Trucks with the IDs that they believe should be allowed to enter. Interesting combinations should be used such as
	* A driver who isn’t allowed into the warehouse but a truck is
	* A driver who is allowed in and a truck that isn’t allowed in.
	* A driver and a truck who are both allowed to enter but do not match on the sheet.

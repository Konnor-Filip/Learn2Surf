                    The purpose of this
                    module is not to give a single, all-encompassing lesson, but instead to give directions to existing
                    lessons. These
                    lessons focus on different aspects of difficulties that children face online. It is recommended to

                <ul>
                    <li>Teach one or more linked modules as is.</li>
                    <li>Incorporate parts from the modules into your teaching style.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>What identifies as bullying:<ul>
                                <li>&quot;Seek to harm, intimidate, or coerce (someone perceived as vulnerable)&quot;
                                </li>
                                <li>Repeated attempts to upset or harass someone.</li>
                                <li>Incidents in which one party is at an advantage and uses that power over the other.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>This can be physical strength, information, materials, and/or influence.

                                <li>Single incident of rejection, aggression, or negative social interaction.</li>
                                <li>Mutual disagreements between two parties, neither utilizes an advantage in the
                                    situation.

                        and/or stop others from bullying “you”.</h3>
                        <ul>
                        <li>First steps:<ul>
                                <li>Take an emotional step back and work out if this is just banter or malicious in
                                    nature.</li>
                                <li>In either case, let the other party know that you aren’t comfortable with the
                                    situation.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Secondary steps:<ul>
                                <li>If the other party de-escalates, save evidence (if possible) of the interaction and
                                    calmly go through it
                                    with someone you trust. Don’t take action unless it is determined that danger is
                                    presented to either
                                    party.</li>
                                <li>If the other party continues, attempt to disengage from the situation. Save all
                                    possible evidence and
                                    details from the event. Talk to someone you trust; an adult if possible. Determine
                                    what to do from there
                                    with advice. Whatever the action is, don’t consider revenge as a motivator.</li>

                                <li>Block contact if necessary. Do not respond to bullying.</li>
                                <li>Never seek revenge. This ends up causing large problems in the future.

                                <li>Remove what content you can that offended the other party.</li>
                                <li>Apologize to the other party about the actions you have taken.</li>
                                <li>Talk with any others that have become involved in the situation.</li>

                        </li>

                                <li>Monitor if others are still bullying due to the content. Discourage this where
                                    possible.</li>

                        <li>For variation: Describe the relationship between the two parties, the platform on which it
                            was shared.</li>
                        <li>Additional action: What would be the next action to take if the student is put into the
                            position of either party
                            (or perhaps both).</li>
                        <li>Example: “You upload a picture of you and a friend out at a restaurant. A third party posts
                            a negative comment
                            on the picture”

                        <li>Additional action: Show more context for the post. This can be good to demonstrate what is

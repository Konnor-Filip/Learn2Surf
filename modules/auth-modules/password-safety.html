                <p>While phishing is on the rise in terms of number of attacks. The most common type of cyber attack is
                    malware. Malware is a piece of malicious software that could damage your computer, steal finacial
                    information or be used to spy on individuals. In recent news WannaCry, a type of malware known as
                    ransomware, spread throughout Europe an caused an estimated $4 billion in losses. With the threat of
                    losing data, money, or even your computer, malware is something to be taken seriously. So We are
                    creating content to help teach children about what malware is, how to avoid it, and how they can protect
                    themselves from it.</p>

                <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
                <ul style="display:table; margin: 0 auto">
                    <li>Students will be able to understand the rational behind the most common password attacks and how they can
                        compromise a
                        password.</li>
                    <li> Students will be able to differentiate between good and bad passwords with regards to the most common
                        password
                        attacks.</li>
                    <li> Students will be able to construct passwords that are both memorable and secure against the most common
                        password
                        attacks.</li>
                    <li> Students will be able to create memorization techniques that will allow the students to more easily
                        remember secure
                        passwords.</li>
                    <li> Students will be able to recognize a social engineering attempt to gain password information.</li>
                    <li> Students recognize the different aspects of password safety.</li>
                    <ul style="display:table;">
                        <li> Students will be able to explain why recording passwords reduces their effectiveness.</li>
                        <li> Students will be able to explain why password reuse can create problems.</li>
                        <li> Students will be able to explain why password sharing can be dangerous.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h2>Class Discovery (Teacher)</h2>
                <p>What type of groups does your class work well in?
                What size of groups can you divide your class into?
                What ways do your students learn best?</p>
                <h2>Warm-up</h2>
                <p>Teacher shows multiple passwords on screen. Students use Think Pair Share to determine which passwords are good and which are bad.</p>
                <h2>Whole Class Discussion (PowerPoint Slides)</h2>
                <p>Teacher will ask the students input on where they use passwords in their lives. Ex. social media, email, school accounts
                etc. Teacher has a discussion with the class on why they believe it is important to have a password on their
                information. Then leads into how to build a strong password. (Slides needed) After slides they will move into three
                activities.</p>
                <h2>Group Activity 2/3 way through lesson</h2>
                <p>Students get in groups
                Make a password that they believe is secure
                Discuss why they think it is a good password
                Check password against [https://howsecureismypassword.net/](https://howsecureismypassword.net/)
            
                Students pair up and one is assigned the password protector and one is assigned the password getter. The protector is
                given a password and they must prevent the getter from retrieving the password. The getter can use any methods they can
                think of to try and social engineer the protector to giving up the password.</p>
                <h2>Individual Wrap-up (Worksheet)</h2>
                <p>Have students share what they learned through this exercise. Also have them think about how the passwords will affect
                their lives and how they can implement what they learned in class.</p>

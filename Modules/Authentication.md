Course: Authentication
Module Title: Password Creation/Safety (1/2)
Module Time:
Assumptions: Assume that the student knows what a password is for (logging into an account).
Materials: Projector for slides, access to a computer, 
Learning Objectives:
* Students are able to differentiate between a good password and a bad password. 
* Students are able to construct a strong password.
* Students are able to memorize their passwords for different websites.
* Students will be able to recognize a social engineering attempt to gain password information.
* Students will be able to explain why recording passwords reduces their effectiveness, why password reuse can create problems, and why password sharing can be dangerous.

Class Discovery (Teacher): 

Authentication Course Introduction Overview:
    What is authentication?
    Why do we need a password?
    How can a password be cracked?

Warm-up: Teacher will ask the students input on where they use passwords in their lives. Ex. social media, email, school accounts etc. Teacher has a discussion with the class on why they believe it is important to have a password on their information. Then leads into how to build a strong password. (Slides needed) After slides they will move into three activities.
    
Activities (Nano-modules):
    **Make sure that students do NOT use their own passwords during activities**
    Whole Class: 
        Teacher shows multiple passwords on screen. Students use Think Pair Share to determine which passwords are good and which are bad. 
    Group:
        Students get in groups
        Make a password that they believe is secure
        Discuss why they think it is a good password
        Check password against https://howsecureismypassword.net/

        Students pair up and one is assigned the password protector and one is assigned the password getter. The protector is given a password and they must prevent the getter from retrieving the password. The getter can use any methods they can think of to try and social engineer the protector to giving up the password.

Wrap-up: Have students share what they learned through this exercise. Also have them think about how the passwords will affect their lives and how they can implement what they learned in class. 

Teacher Reflection: Up to teacher to determine if they enjoyed the lesson and would like to teach it further. 


Course: Authentication
Module Title: Multifactor Authentication (2/2)
Module Time:
Assumptions:
Materials:
Learning Objectives:
* Students are able to describe the types of authentication methods that are most commonly used.
* Students are able to implement the correct level of protection for various types of accounts and devices.
* Students are able to differentiate the positives and negatives of using single-factor authentication vs a multi-factor authentication method.

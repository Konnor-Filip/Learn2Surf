## Project Timeline
This project will consist of five main sprints and two smaller sprints. The project will kick off with researching styles of course structure to ensure the best learning experience and engagement from students in the middle school grade range (6-8). We will create a template in this first sprint that will be adaptable to each course topic to allow for ease of use. This is estimated to take one to two weeks. The main 5 core topics will last two weeks per topic and the final weeks of the project will be for corrections and small changes.

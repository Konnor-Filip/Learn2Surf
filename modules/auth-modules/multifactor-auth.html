                <p>While phishing is on the rise in terms of number of attacks. The most common type of cyber attack is
                    malware. Malware is a piece of malicious software that could damage your computer, steal finacial
                    information or be used to spy on individuals. In recent news WannaCry, a type of malware known as
                    ransomware, spread throughout Europe an caused an estimated $4 billion in losses. With the threat of
                    losing data, money, or even your computer, malware is something to be taken seriously. So We are
                    creating content to help teach children about what malware is, how to avoid it, and how they can
                    protect
                    themselves from it.</p>

                    passwords, using a student ID card at the library, a locker combination, etc. The teacher will have the students
                    discuss how the forms of authentication are different from each other as a lead up to introducing the 5 different

                <p><strong>Introduction to multi-factor authentication (Size: Any, Time: 10-20 minutes, Required resources: Provided
                        slides and either access to a computer or a whiteboard)</strong> <br></p>
                <p><strong>Show</strong>: (Slide-Authentication definition slide) <br>
                    <strong>Ask</strong>: What does Authentication mean? <br>
                    <strong>Say</strong>: Authentication is the process or action of verifying the identity of a user or process. <br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Show</strong>: (Slide-Something you know, something you have, something you are) <br>
                    <strong>Say</strong>: Passwords are just one type of authentication that helps to make sure it is really you on an
                    account. There are many ways that help keep others out of your accounts.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Show</strong>: (Side-Something you know) <br>
                    <strong>Say</strong>: The most common type of authentication is something-you-know. Something you know refers to
                    something that you have committed to memory and is something that only you know. An example of something you know is
                    a password, which is the most frequently used something-you-know authentication. <br>
                    <strong>Ask</strong>: Have you or someone that you know ever used an ATM? What was needed to use it? (Expected
                    responses: a card and a PIN number, hint as needed. An alternative to an ATM includes a checkout at a store) <br>
                    <strong>Say</strong>: A PIN is another something-you-know type of authentication. Something you know is the most
                    common form of authentication, but is also seen as a weaker form when compared to the other factors. Its strength
                    relies on the complexity and length of the password. PINs are usually less secure than passwords because they are
                    shorter. The card is an example of something-you-have.<br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Show</strong>: (Slide-Something you have) <br>
                    <strong>Say</strong>: The second most common type of authentication is something you have. This is something that is
                    usually physically kept on you. An example of this is the bank cards or credit cards mentioned before. <br>
                    <strong>Ask</strong>: What other items could be used as a form of something you have authentication? (Expected
                    responses: An ID Card or Mobile Phone App) <br>
                    <strong>Say</strong>: Something you have can be a variety of different things, which are typically more secure than
                    something you know types of authentication. These can include single use passwords from a phone&#39;s apps or text
                    messages and ID badges which can be used to gain access to buildings. While being more secure that passwords because
                    they are physically kept on you, they can be lost or stolen. <br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Show</strong>: (Slide-Something you are) <br>
                    <strong>Say</strong>: Something you are is a type of authentication that is become more popular. Something you are
                    is often referred to as biometric security. This is something that is unique to you and won&#39;t likely change.
                    Fingerprints are unique and are often the most common type of something you are authentication. <br>
                    <strong>Ask</strong>: Thinking about something that is unique to yourself, what could be used as authentication?
                    <br>
                    <strong>Say</strong>: There are several things that are unique to you that can be used for biometrics. Fingerprints,
                    eye scanners, facial recognition, and voice recognition are each examples of a biometric authentication and fall
                    under something-you-are. This type of authentication is some of the most secure because of the unique differences in
                    biometrics. However, if the information for your biometrics is ever stolen, they can&#39;t be changed. This leads to
                    potentially permanant compromise of security for that system. <br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Show</strong>: (Slide-Somewhere you are) <br>
                    <strong>Say</strong>: Somewhere you are is a type of authentication that uses location for identification purposes.
                    While not commonly noticed, somewhere you are types of authentication are often used to check for activity that is
                    outside of an approved location. An example of this is allowing your phone to unlock automatically while you are
                    home. <br>
                    <strong>Ask</strong>: Where might somewhere you are authentication be helpful?<br>
                    <strong>Say</strong>: It may not be the most used or noticeable type of authentication but it is still a helpful
                    form of security. A great example of this is that banks often use location to check to see if money was stolen.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Show</strong>: (Slide-Something you do) <br>
                    <strong>Say</strong>: Something you do is a type of authentication that uses routines or patterns that are unique to
                    you for identification. <br>
                    <strong>Ask</strong>: Is there something in your routine that you consider unique? How could it be used for
                    authentication? <br>
                    <strong>Say</strong>: This is the least common type of authentication. Technology surrounding it is in the early
                    stages of being developed and maybe become more prominent in the future. An example of this type of authentication
                    would be detecting a suspicious login at a time you aren&#39;t really active on an account. If you normally log into
                    your account between 5p.m. to 10p.m., a login at 3a.m. may be considered suspicious.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Show</strong>: (Slide-Multifactor Authentication definition) <br>
                    <strong>Ask</strong>: What could Multifactor Authentication mean? <br>
                    <strong>Say</strong>: The combination of two or more types of authentication to make something more secure. <br>
                </p>
                <p>Have the students break down into individuals or small groups to come up with other examples of authentication they
                    have seen before. Let them work for 3-5 minutes. <br>
                    Once time is up, have them volunteer examples they have come up with. Record the responses for all to see
                    (whiteboard or computer).<br>
                    <strong>Discuss</strong>: Go through the responses and identify which ones are single authentication, two-factor
                    authentication, and some ways that additional authentication can be added. <br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Example</strong>-Bank card: PIN-know/Card-have <br>
                    <strong>Example</strong>-Online account: Password-know/Phone-have

                <h4 id="activity">Activity</h4>
                <p>Have the students get into groups of five. Give 5 envelopes to each group. Inside the envelopes will be one of three
                    roles for the student to be. Each set of envelopes should have 1 authenticator, 1 gatekeeper, and 3 personnel
                    (personnel can be changed if class size is not divisible by 5).</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Authenticator (1) - This student will have a card in their envelope with the correct authentication to go
                        through the gate. </li>
                    <li>Gatekeeper (1) - This student will have a card in their envelope that shows which two types of authentication
                        the personnel need to show to get through the gate. </li>
                    <li>Personnel (3) - These students will have five different cards in each of their envelopes. These cards will
                        consist of an eye, a fingerprint, a handprint, a password, and a pin number. Each student will have a different
                        variation of these cards (colors/symbols). </li>
                </ol>
                <p>To start the role play, the gatekeeper will say &quot;I need to see <strong>__</strong> and <strong>__</strong> forms
                    of authentication to get through the gate.&quot; The blanks are the two types of authentication that were provided
                    in the envelope.</p>
                <p>Next, a student with the personnel role will approach the gate and show the two types of authentication requested by
                    the gatekeeper. </p>
                <p>Then the Authenticator will check the color/symbols of the authentication that the personnel showed. If they are
                    correct, the authenticator will say &quot;Authentication Matched&quot;. If one does not match, they will say
                    &quot;<strong>_</strong> Matches but <strong>__</strong> does not&quot;. Else if neither matches they will say
                    &quot;Authentication Denied&quot;</p>
                <p>Based on the Authenticators answer the gatekeeper will either let the personnel through the gate or tell them sorry
                    they are not allowed through.</p>
                <p>This process then repeats with the next personnel. </p>
                <p>After the groups have finished, have the students put their cards back in the envelopes and pass them to the next
                    group. This will give each student a chance to play one of the three roles in the game. Repeat for as long as time
                    allows. </p>

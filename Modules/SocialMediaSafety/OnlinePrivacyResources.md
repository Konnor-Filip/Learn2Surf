## Forward
Keeping children safe online is difficult with the ever changing online enviornment.
The good news is there are a number of concepts that continue to be excellent baselines to keep them safe online.
The purpose of this module is not to give a single, all-encompassing lesson but instead give directions to existing lessons.
These lessons focus on a different aspect of difficulties that children face online.
It is recommended to either: 
- Teach one or more linked modules as is.
- Incorporate parts from the modules into your teaching style.

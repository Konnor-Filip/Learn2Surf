## Forward
Keeping children safe online is difficult with the ever-changing online environment.
The good news is there are a number of concepts that continue to be excellent baselines to keep them safe online.
The purpose of this module is not to give a single, all-encompassing lesson, but instead give directions to existing lessons.
These lessons focus on different aspects of difficulties that children face online.
It is recommended to either: 
- Teach one or more linked modules as is.
- Incorporate parts from the modules into your teaching style.

## Basic Concepts
Below are a few major concepts to help establish your own lessons covering online privacy.
### 1. What data can be tracked, how it is collected, and how it can be used.
* Teachinctrl.org has an excellent list of points for this.
  * Page 2 of their free lesson materials download. Follow the Teachinctrl.org: Privacy lesson link and scroll to the bottom.
* Below is a rough layout to cover these three points about data and information.
#### 1.1. What they are looking for (Data tracking)
* Companies will track where you go online for marketing purposes and other general information when they can. Some of the things they look for:
  * Where and when you use your device
  * Websites you visit
  * Terms used when searching
  * Non-sensitive, personally identifiable information
* Shady individuals/groups also are looking to find something that can lead to a weakness in your protections.
  * Personally identifiable information
  * Device identifiable information 
    * Examples: Phone, Apple based OS
    * Desktop, Windows-based OS
* Everyday individuals (friends and strangers) are also curious about what you do on the internet.
  * Your stance and opinion on any topic they are interested in.
* Remember, anything that goes onto the internet is there permanently. Wayback Machine is a good example of an internet archive.
#### 1.2. How they get it (Data collection).
* Companies:
  * Browser that you use
  * Website cookies
  * Information submitted (logging in, filling out forms)
  * Social media (web crawlers)
* Shady individuals/groups:
  * Tracking software
  * Social media (manual and/or web crawlers)
  * Information submitted (surveys of all types, excellent for collecting password hints such as “my first teacher, my first animal”)
* Everyday individuals:
  * What you say in online communications (Forum posts, social media posts, email, texts)
  * Anywhere you are mentioned. This can include news or posts others create (truthful or not!)
#### 1.3. How it is used (Data utilization).
* Companies
  * Marketing to you and those that are similar to you
* Shady individuals/groups:
  * Attacks on your profiles (identifying passwords directly or indirectly)
  * Identifying vulnerabilities that could lead to a successful attack
* Everyday individuals:
  * Form opinions based on information gathered
### 2. How data can be used to identify someone.
* This includes how seemingly benign information can be led back to a student or how a student can identify if someone is not who they say they are.
  * An exercise in sleuthing through social media makes for the best exercise to make students think about both of these aspects
    * Make sure to emphasize discretion and safety
    * **Always** create the exercise rather than use live examples. A student may find something problematic without the whole story!
* Sample exercise: company investigating possible candidates.
  * Should consist of 3-5 small documents/posts for students to review
  * “Candidate submits a small resume post”
  * Each candidate has a few publicly available posts that possibly contradict information in the resume post or show them to be in poor reputation (legal problems?)
* Sample exercise: Half the story, all the problems.
  * Students are told a story about a person sleuthing up someone else's past.
  * The sleuth uncovers information about the other person that makes them look bad.
  * The sleuth publishes a story about the other person.
  * Once sleuth publishes their findings, the whole truth comes out that shows that the original story was benign.

Big Ideas:
We want to create an application that teaches kids how to surf the internet safely.

Brainstorm:

-Age range we want to shoot for is middle school
--Justification for Middle schools students is the average age a student recives a smart phone (11-12 years old)

-Labs that teach skills or valuable lessons
--Labs could be gamified to incentivize engagement

-App should teach valuable internet surfing skills
--App should inform kids about scams or other hazadous 

-User engagment
--Build a profile of the different types of users
---Example: Student A,B,C. Each might have a different personality and familiarity with technology. We have the desire to create an accessable application,
   so finding a solution that works for all of them would benefit the most people.

-Vet ideas through teachers
--Kids are a protected class. Thus, we need to be careful with how we interact with them, to avoid most complications, we need to interact with teachers
--Focus on a panel of those with educational expertise, gather their thoughts and hopefully their endorsement. 

-Uno has large educational ecosystem, would be a great resource/contact on how we can go about doing this
--They could be a huge resource for us to create panels to receive feedback.

-Drag and Drop
--Tangible, hands on, ways to get kids to interact with the internet and more specifically technology. 

-Unplugged exercise
--Connect wire and cardboard boxes to demonstrate how a network works.

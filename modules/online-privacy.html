          <p>Keeping children safe online is difficult with the ever-changing online environment.
            The good news is there are a number of concepts that continue to be excellent baselines to keep them safe online.
            The purpose of this module is not to give a single, all-encompassing lesson, but instead give directions to existing
            lessons.
            These lessons focus on different aspects of difficulties that children face online.
            It is recommended to either: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Teach one or more linked modules as is.</li>
            <li>Incorporate parts from the modules into your teaching style.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic Concepts</h2>
          <p>Below are a few major concepts to help establish your own lessons covering online privacy.</p>
          <h3 id="1-what-data-can-be-tracked-how-it-is-collected-and-how-it-can-be-used-">1. What data can be tracked, how it is
            collected, and how it can be used.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Teachinctrl.org has an excellent list of points for this.<ul>
                <li>Page 2 of their free lesson materials download. Follow the Teachinctrl.org: Privacy lesson link and scroll to
                  the bottom.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Below is a rough layout to cover these three points about data and information.</li></ul>
            <h4 id="1-1-what-they-are-looking-for-data-tracking-">1.1. What they are looking for (Data tracking)</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Companies will track where you go online for marketing purposes and other general information when they can. Some
              of the things they look for:<ul>
                <li>Where and when you use your device</li>
                <li>Websites you visit</li>
                <li>Terms used when searching</li>
                <li>Non-sensitive, personally identifiable information</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Shady individuals/groups also are looking to find something that can lead to a weakness in your protections.<ul>
                <li>Personally identifiable information</li>
                <li>Device identifiable information <ul>
                    <li>Examples: Phone, Apple based OS</li>
                    <li>Desktop, Windows-based OS</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Everyday individuals (friends and strangers) are also curious about what you do on the internet.<ul>
                <li>Your stance and opinion on any topic they are interested in.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Remember, anything that goes onto the internet is there permanently. Wayback Machine is a good example of an
              internet archive.</li></ul>
              <h4 id="1-2-how-they-get-it-data-collection-">1.2. How they get it (Data collection).</h4>
              <ul>
            <li>Companies:<ul>
                <li>Browser that you use</li>
                <li>Website cookies</li>
                <li>Information submitted (logging in, filling out forms)</li>
                <li>Social media (web crawlers)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Shady individuals/groups:<ul>
                <li>Tracking software</li>
                <li>Social media (manual and/or web crawlers)</li>
                <li>Information submitted (surveys of all types, excellent for collecting password hints such as “my first
                  teacher, my first animal”)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Everyday individuals:<ul>
                <li>What you say in online communications (Forum posts, social media posts, email, texts)</li>
                <li>Anywhere you are mentioned. This can include news or posts others create (truthful or not!)</li></ul>
                <h4 id="1-3-how-it-is-used-data-utilization-">1.3. How it is used (Data utilization).</h4>
                <ul>
            <li>Companies<ul>
                <li>Marketing to you and those that are similar to you</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Shady individuals/groups:<ul>
                <li>Attacks on your profiles (identifying passwords directly or indirectly)</li>
                <li>Identifying vulnerabilities that could lead to a successful attack</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Everyday individuals:<ul>
                <li>Form opinions based on information gathered</li></ul>
                <h3 id="2-how-data-can-be-used-to-identify-someone-">2. How data can be used to identify someone.</h3>
                <ul>
            <li>This includes how seemingly benign information can be led back to a student or how a student can identify if
              someone is not who they say they are.<ul>
                <li>An exercise in sleuthing through social media makes for the best exercise to make students think about both of
                  these aspects<ul>
                    <li>Make sure to emphasize discretion and safety</li>
                    <li><strong>Always</strong> create the exercise rather than use live examples. A student may find something
                      problematic without the whole story!</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Sample exercise: company investigating possible candidates.<ul>
                <li>Should consist of 3-5 small documents/posts for students to review</li>
                <li>“Candidate submits a small resume post”</li>
                <li>Each candidate has a few publicly available posts that possibly contradict information in the resume post or
                  show them to be in poor reputation (legal problems?)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Sample exercise: Half the story, all the problems.<ul>
                <li>Students are told a story about a person sleuthing up someone else&#39;s past.</li>
                <li>The sleuth uncovers information about the other person that makes them look bad.</li>
                <li>The sleuth publishes a story about the other person.</li>
                <li>Once sleuth publishes their findings, the whole truth comes out that shows that the original story was benign.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

First teach the material that is in the module. After choose use these three methods to work through the material.
Guided Practice - teacher takes students through an interactive activity
Collaborative Process - have students work in partners or a group to do an activity related to the subject
Independent Practice - have the student practice on their own (worksheets)
End the lesson with a recap and have the students identify the key points.

Consider grouping. What size works best for age group and activity?
For our case random or student picked grouping will probably work best.
We will not know the students or the classroom these will be used in so we cannot choose Ability grouping, knowledge grouping, etc.
Might want to mention if desks need moved etc to help facilitate activities.

Think about Multiple Intelligences (how people learn material best) based on Howard Gardner's Theory. This article also gives example activities for each of the 8 types of intelligence
Word Smart (Verbal-Linguistic)
Math Smart (Logical-Mathematical)
Picture Smart (Spatial Intelligence)
Music Smart 
Body Smart (Bodily Kinesthetic)
People Smart (Interpersonal) 
Self Smart (Intrapersonal)
Nature Smart

Introduction should include a gauge of what the students already know. This way you do not repeat information. Ideas for the start are a challenging question, movie clip, or a survey. 
Do we need modifications for special needs students? 
Look at how long an activity will take to complete?
Do we want to set a certain time that each module will take?
All students should participate in each activity. They should be designed so this is possible.
Outlines an 8 step lesson plan:
1. Lesson information: content area, grade level of target group of students, and timeframe of the lesson
2. Lesson topic
3. Standards, benchmarks, or performance standards addressed in the lesson
4. Intended learning outcomes for students
5. Instructional resources
6. Arrangement of environment (e.g., independent seat work, cooperative groups, work on projects or presentations, specific modifications)
7. Instructional activities:
    a. Introduction to lesson
    b. Lesson development (be sure to include lesson adaptations for students with special needs)
    c. Assessment activities (be sure to include adaptations for students with special needs)
    d. Wrap up
8. Teacher reflection

Dr. Hale Notes
Loves idea of using different intelligences throughout the lesson plan
Physical metaphores like role play
Paper airplane example from a fly test TDD
Unplugged and plugged in examples
Mix different intelligences together 
- do a crossword that the answers are needed for a different project (breakout box style)
- groups are helpful to bring different learning styles together people can work on the parts that fit their personality best

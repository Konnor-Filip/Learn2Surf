                <p>There are times when a password is just not enough, extra steps are needed. That is when authentication comes to play.
                This module's purpose is not to give an all-encompassing lesson that will cover all topics relating to Authentication,
                but instead give the fundamentals of Authentication.</p>

                    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
                    <p>During this course, students will be able to</p>
                    <ul style="display:table;">
                        <li><b>Differentiate</b> between the five different factors of authentication.</li>
                        <li><b>Describe</b> the types of authentication methods that are most commonly used.</li>
                        <li><b>Implement</b> the correct level of protection for various types of accounts and devices.</li>
                        <li><b>Differentiate</b> the positives and negatives of using single-factor authentication vs a multi-factor authentication method.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
                    <p>Below are a few concepts to help establish your own lessons. Also helpful to create a short 5-10 minute lesson.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Identify the three primary and two secondary types of authentication.<ul></li>
                        <li>Primary 1: Knowledge/Something you know<ul>
                                <li>Examples: Passwords, pin numbers, phone unlock patterns</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Primary 2: Possession/Something you have<ul>
                                <li>Examples: Physical card (such as a credit card), one time use password</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Primary 3: Inherent/Something you are<ul>
                                <li>Examples: Fingerprint, voice</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Secondary 1: Location</li>
                        <li>Secondary 2: Time</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Identify advantages and disadvantages of using more than one factor when authenticating.<ul></li>
                        <li>The primary advantage of multiple factors is that the failure of one factor does not compromise the account.
                        </li>
                        <li>The primary disadvantage is the additional time required to access the account. (seconds add up quickly)</li></ul>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Class Discovery (Teacher)</h2>
                    <p>What type of groups does your class work well in?
                        What size of groups can you divide your class into?
                        What ways do your students learn best?</p>
                    <h2>Warm-up</h2>
                    <p>Students will be asked about where they use authentication in their lives. This can include logging in with passwords,
                    using a student ID card at the library, a locker combination, etc. The teacher will have the students discuss how the
                    forms of authentication are different from each other as a lead up to introducing the 5 different forms of
                    authentication.</p>
                    <h2>Whole Class Discussion</h2>
                    <p><b>Introduction to multi-factor authentication (Size: Any, Time: 10-20 minutes, Required resources: Provided slides and
                    either access to a computer or a whiteboard)</b></p>
                    <p>Using the provided teacher guide and powerpoint in the Google Drive, use the Show-Ask-Say format to get the class discussion. Here is an example taken from the lesson:</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Example</h3>
                    <p><b>Show:</b>(Slide-Authentication definition slide)</p>
                    <p><b>Ask:</b> What does Authentication mean?</p>
                    <p><b>Say:</b> Authentication is the process or action of verifying the identity of a user or process.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Following this, Have the students break down into individuals or small groups to come up with other examples of authentication they have
                    seen before. Let them work for 3-5 minutes.
                    Once time is up, have them volunteer examples they have come up with. Record the responses for all to see (whiteboard or
                    computer).
                    Discuss: Go through the responses and identify which ones are single authentication, two-factor authentication, and some
                    ways that additional authentication can be added.</p>

                    <p><b>Example 1:</b> Online Account: Password-Know/Phone-Have</p>
                    <p><b>Example 2:</b> Credit Card: PIN-Know/Card-Have</p>
                    <h2>Wrap-up:</h2>
                    <p>Have students share what they learned through this exercise. Share that authentication can be adjusted in how
                    lenient/strict it is in matching for keeping a location secure.</p>
                    <h2>Teacher Reflection:</h2>
                    <p>Do you feel your students have a firm grasp on the types of authentication factors and their usage?</p>

# Course: Authentication
## Module Title: Multifactor Authentication (2/2)
### Module Time: See individual micro-modules
### Assumptions: Students have used passwords before.
### Materials: See individual micro-modules
### Definitions:
* Authentication
* Multi-Factor Authentication
* Factors of Authentication
  * Something you are (Biomentrics)
  * Something you have (Token: Smart card/one-time passcode)
  * Something you know (Password/PIN)
  * Somewhere you are (Geo-location)
  * Something you do (Mouse movement/signiture)
### Learning Objectives:
* Students will be able to differentiate between the five different factors of authentication. 
* Students are able to describe the types of authentication methods that are most commonly used.
* Students are able to implement the correct level of protection for various types of accounts and devices.
* Students are able to differentiate the positives and negatives of using single-factor authentication vs a multi-factor authentication method.

#### Class Discovery (Teacher):
What type of groups does your class work well in?
What size of groups can you divide your class into?
What ways do your students learn best?

### Warm-up:
Students will be asked about where they use authentication in their lives. This can include logging in with passwords, using a student ID card at the library, a locker combination, etc. The teacher will have the students discuss how the forms of authentication are different from each other as a lead up to introducing the 5 different forms of authentication. 

## Class Discussion:
### Whole Class Discussion:
**Introduction to multi-factor authentication (Size: Any, Time: 10-20 minutes, Required resources: Provided slides and either access to a computer or a whiteboard)** <br>
**Show**: (Slide-Something you know, something you have, something you are) <br>
**Say**: Passwords are just one type of authentication that help to make sure it is really you on an account. There are many different ways that help keep others out of your accounts.

**Show**: (Side-Something you know) <br>
**Say**: The most common type of authentication is something-you-know. Something you know refers to something that you have committed to memory and is something that only you know. An example of something you know is a password, which is the most frequently used something-you-know authentication. <br>
**Ask**: Have you or someone that you know ever used an ATM? What was needed to use it? (Expected responses: a card and a PIN number, hint as needed. An alternative to an ATM include a checkout at a store) <br>
**Say**: A PIN number is another something-you-know. Something you know authentication is the most common form of authentication but is also seen as a weaker when compared to the other factors. Its strength is relies on the complexity and length of the password. PINs are usually less secure than passwords because they are shorter in length.  The card is an example of something-you-have.

**Show**: (Slide-Something you have) <br>
**Say**: The second most common type of authentication is Something You Have. This is something that is usually physically kept on you. An example of this is the bank cards or credit cards mentioned before. <br>
**Ask**: When unlocking a phone have any of you used something besides a PIN number? (Expected responses: fingerprint or face)

**Show**: (Slide-Something you are) <br>
**Say**: Fingerprints, eye scanners, facial recognition, and voice recognition are each examples of a biometric authentication and fall under something-you-are.
Have the students break down into individuals or small groups to come up with other examples of authentication they have seen before. Let them work for 3-5 minutes. 
Once time is up, have them volunteer examples they have come up with. Record the responses for all to see (whiteboard or computer).
**Discuss**: Go through the responses and identify which ones are single authentication, two-factor authentication, and some ways that additional authentication can be added. <br>
**Example**-Bank card: PIN-know/Card-have <br>
**Example**-Online account: Password-know/Phone-have

**Show**: (Slide-Somewhere you are) <br>

**Show**: (Slide-Something you do) <br>

## Group Activities
### Small Group:
#### Materials
* Envelopes
* Print outs of cards
* Paper clips to keep envelopes/cards organized

#### Preparation
* Groups of 5 students
* Groups of  5 envelopes with cards inside

#### Goal
Students will roleplay using the "Something they know" and "Something they are" topics that were taught in the lesson. 

#### Activity
Have the students get into groups of five. Give 5 envelopes to each group. Inside the envelopes will be one of three roles for the student to be. Each set of envelopes should have 1 authenticator, 1 gatekeeper, and 3 personnel (personnel can be changed if class size is not divisible by 5).

1. Authenticator (1) - This student will have a card in their envelope with the correct authentication to go through the gate. 
2. Gatekeeper (1) - This student will have a card in their envelope that shows which two types of authentication the personnel need to show to get through the gate. 
3. Personnel (3) - These students will have five different card in their envelope. These cards will consist of an eye, a fingerprint, a handprint, a password, and a pin number. Each student will have a different variation of these cards (colors/symbols). 

To start the role play the gatekeeper will say "I need to see ______ and ______ forms of authentication to get through the gate." The blanks are the two types of authentication that were provided in the envelope.

Next a personnel will approach the gate and show the two types of authentication requested by the gatekeeper. 

Then the Authenticator will check the color/symbols of the authentication that the personnel showed. If they are correct the authenticator will say "Authentication Matched". If one does not match they will say "_____ Matches but ______ does not". Else if neither matches they will say "Authentication Denied"

Based on the Authenticators answer the gatekeeper will either let the personnel through the gate or tell them sorry they are not allowed through.

This process then repeats with the next personnel. 

After the groups have finished have the students put their cards back in the envelopes  and pass them to the next group. This will give each student a chance to play one of the three roles in the game. Repeat for as long as time allows.

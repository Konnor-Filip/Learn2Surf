                <p> Malware is
                a piece of malicious software that could damage your computer, steal financial information, or be used to spy on
                individuals. In recent news WannaCry, a type of malware known as ransomware spread throughout Europe and caused an
                estimated $4 billion in losses. With the threat of losing data, money, or even your computer, malware is something to be
                taken seriously. So We are creating content to help teach children about what malware is, how to avoid it, and how they
                can protect themselves from it.</p>

                    <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
                    <p>Below are a few concepts to help establish your own lessons. Also helpful to create a short 5-10 minute lesson.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Types of malware and the danger they can present<ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Direct interference: These are the most identifiable of malware. They slow and/or stop the victim device from working as
                        intended.<ul>
                                <li>Examples: Ransomware, Hijacker, Direct action</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Information gathering: These are the middle of the road when it comes to detectability. These types of malware are
                        actively performing a task that slow down the device yet present little else to the user. They exist to gather
                        information and send it off to a specific “home” destination.<ul>
                                <li>Examples: Spyware, Adware, Keyloggers</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Backdoor: These are typically very small and very subtle programs. They exist to enable other types of malware to
                        infiltrate the device.<ul>
                                <li>Examples: Rootkits, Worms</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Malware prevention<ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Awareness. For every device, there is malware for it. For every anti-virus, there is malware that can evade it. Be
                        cautious at all times.</li>
                        <li>Keep device software updated. Malware tends to target insecurities in how a device or a program on it works. Updates
                        exist to not only bring new features but also to remove insecurities when possible.</li>
                        <li>Avoid links, websites, and software that are untrustworthy. Beware anything that presents urgency, asks too little for
                        what it offers, or comes from an unusual source.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>

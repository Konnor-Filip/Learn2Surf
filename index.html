            <h2>Motivations</h2>
            <br />
            <p>Learn2Surf is a capstone project started by a group of 5 students.</p>
            <p>We desired to create educational content that would help teach students</p>
            <p>about the dangers of the internet, and the responsibilities that come with browsing it.</p>
            <p>When we started out, we felt that there was a distinct lack of adaquate educational</p>
            <p>content for teachers to use in their classrooms. With the danger of malicious</p>
            <p>actors out in the wild and their increasing prevelence, we felt like we needed </p>
            <p>to take the reigns into our own hands. So we decided to prepare educational content</p>
            <p>that can be consumed by teachers to help educate their students on those dangers</p>
            <p>and how they can protect themselves.</p>

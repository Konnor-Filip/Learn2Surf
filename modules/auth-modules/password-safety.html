                the required lessons to become acquainted with proper password techniques</p>

                <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
                <p>During this course, students will be able to</p>
                <ul style="display:table;">
                    <li><b>Understand</b> the rational behind the most common password attacks and how they can
                        compromise a
                        password.</li>
                    <li><b>Differentiate</b> between good and bad passwords with regards to the most common
                        password
                        attacks.</li>
                    <li><b>Construct</b> passwords that are both memorable and secure against the most common
                        password
                        attacks.</li>
                    <li><b>Create</b> create memorization techniques that will allow the students to more easily
                        remember secure
                        passwords.</li>
                    <li><b>Recognize</b> a social engineering attempt to gain password information.</li>
                    <li><b>Recognize</b> the different aspects of password safety.</li>
                    <ul style="display:table;">
                        <li><b>Explain</b> why recording passwords reduces their effectiveness.</li>
                        <li><b>Explain</b> why password reuse can create problems.</li>
                        <li><b>Explain</b> why password sharing can be dangerous.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
                <p>Below are a few concepts to help establish your own lessons. Also helpful to create a short 5-10 minute lesson.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify ways that others learn our passwords.<ul>
                    </li>
                        <li>Brute force: Hackers can create programs that check every possible combination millions of times per second.</li>
                        <li>Dictionary attack: Brute force attack that adds in words that might be associated with that particular account.</li>
                        <li>Mask attack: Brute force attack that knows part of the password.</li>
                        <li>Password reuse attack: Passwords that have been used on other accounts are tested.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Explain techniques to create secure passwords, maintain their secrecy, and be able to be remembered.<ul></li>
                        <li>Password complexity: Length and variety of characters to include (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special
                        characters/symbols)</li>
                        <li>Don't share passwords: Any time a password is shared, a third party is able to pick it up (unsecure connections).
                        Additionally, you never know if the individual may attempt to use the account linked to the password for an unintended
                        purpose.</li>
                        <li>Recording passwords: Never write down your passwords directly.<ul></li>
                            <li>Memorizing your password is theoretically the best, but remembering a secure jumble of characters is impractical.
                            Recorded but encrypted is a reasonable option.</li></ul>
                        <li>Password managers: These may be useful if many accounts must be maintained, but explain that caution must be taken due
                        to a single point of failure.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
                <h2>Class Discovery (Teacher)</h2>
                <p>What type of groups does your class work well in?
                What size of groups can you divide your class into?
                What ways do your students learn best?</p>
                <h2>Warm-up</h2>
                <p>Teacher shows multiple passwords on screen. Students use Think Pair Share to determine which passwords are good and which are bad.</p>
                <h2>Whole Class Discussion (PowerPoint Slides)</h2>
                <p>Teacher will ask the students input on where they use passwords in their lives. Ex. social media, email, school accounts
                etc. Teacher has a discussion with the class on why they believe it is important to have a password on their
                information. Then leads into how to build a strong password. (Slides needed) After slides they will move into three
                activities.</p>
                <h2>Group Activity 2/3 way through lesson</h2>
                <p>Students get in groups</p>
                <p>Make a password that they believe is secure</p>
                <p>Discuss why they think it is a good password</p>
                <p>Check password against <a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/"> https://howsecureismypassword.net/</a></p>

                <p><b>*Alternatively, contained in the Google Drive resources is an offline version of the worksheet*</b></p>
            
                <p>Students pair up and one is assigned the password protector and one is assigned the password getter. The protector is
                given a password and they must prevent the getter from retrieving the password. The getter can use any methods they can
                think of to try and social engineer the protector to giving up the password.</p>
                <h2>Individual Wrap-up (Worksheet)</h2>
                <p>Have students share what they learned through this exercise. Also have them think about how the passwords will affect
                their lives and how they can implement what they learned in class.</p>
